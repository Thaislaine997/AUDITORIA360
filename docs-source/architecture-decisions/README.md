# 🏗️ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **Documenting key architectural decisions for AUDITORIA360**

---

## 📋 **What are ADRs?**

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during the development of AUDITORIA360. Each ADR captures:

- **Context**: Why was this decision needed?
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

## 🤝 **Decision Process**

### **1. Identify Need**
- Technical challenge or architectural choice
- Multiple viable options exist
- Decision has significant impact

### **2. Research & Analysis**
- Gather requirements and constraints
- Research available options
- Analyze trade-offs

### **3. Proposal**
- Create ADR with template
- Present to architecture team
- Gather feedback and iterate

### **4. Decision**
- Team discussion and consensus
- Document final decision
- Update status to "Accepted"

### **5. Implementation**
- Implement the decision
- Monitor consequences
- Update ADR if needed
